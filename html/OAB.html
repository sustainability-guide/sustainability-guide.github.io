        <p class="OAA">Humans waste roughly a third of food produced globally. Wasted food rots in landfill releasing methane into the atmosphere,
        </br>a greenhouse gas that harms the environment. Additionally, 5.8 million people in the UK live in poverty,
        </br>struggling to afford food. In an initiative to put a stop to this wasteful lifestyle, The Real Junk Food Project was born.
        </br>They are a group of pay-as-you-feel cafés, using discarded food from supermarkets, restaurants and local stores that would
        </br>otherwise go to waste, creating delicious, healthy meals on a donation basis. The Real Junk Food Project perfectly aligns with
      </br> Manchester’s zero waste strategy.</p>
